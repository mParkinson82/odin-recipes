          <img src="../images/moroccan-eggplant.png" alt="An eggplant dish">
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Think of this as a mid-week take on traditional stuffed eggplant 
                dishes you find in Arabic cuisine that involves hollowing out eggplants, 
                stuffing with rice, meat, herbs and nuts, often baked in a tomato sauce. 
                Sounds magnificent, doesn’t it? And it is.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan).</li>
                <li>Sweat eggplants (recommended, see Note 5 to skip) – Cut eggplants in half then score with 2.5cm / 1" diamonds. Rub surface with salt, getting some into the slits. Place face down in a colander and set aside for 30 minutes. Gently squeeze like a sponge to remove excess water, pat surface dry.</li>
                <li>Mix Chermoula spice mix ingredients in a bowl. Remove 3 teaspoons for the meat and set aside. Add olive oil and lemon juice into the remaining spice mix and mix into a paste.</li>
                <li>Roast eggplant – Place eggplant on baking tray. Slather spice mix onto the surface. Roast for 45 minutes until softened.</li>
                <li>Spiced topping – Heat oil in a non stick skillet over medium high heat. Cook onion and garlic for 1 minute. Turn heat up to high, add lamb/beef and cook, breaking it up as you go, until you no longer see red. Add reserved spices and salt, then cook for a further 1 minute. Add tomato paste and cook for 1 minute. Stir in water, cook for 1 minute until it's juicy but not watery.</li>
                <li>Assemble – Top eggplant with beef/lamb. Sprinkle over coriander, dollop with yogurt and pine nuts. Finish with an extra drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, if desired!</li>
